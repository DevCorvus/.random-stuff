# Rusty "game"

Just a toy program to experiment with Rust. It generates a grid of squares with entities like the player and objects that can be pushed.

### Ideas

- Random spot to "win" the game, score points and move to a new and more difficult grid.
- Procedural and hand-crafted (puzzle) grids.
- AI entities that try to trap the player and a timer (?).
